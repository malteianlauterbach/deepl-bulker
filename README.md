This Flask-based web application allows users to translate documents using the DeepL translation API. Users can upload files for translation, 
including ZIP archives, and the application preserves the folder structure of the uploaded files in the translated output.
Translated documents are available for download as a ZIP archive. The application includes error handling, logging, and folder reset functionality for a smooth user experience.

    Install dependencies using ``` pip install -r requirements.txt. ```
    Set up a DeepL API key.
